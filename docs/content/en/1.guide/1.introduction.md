# Introduction
 
When mentioning date pickers, people might think about the `DatePicker` from component libraries, however, `DatePicker` is usually a combination of `Input` and `Calendar`. Although this suits most form scenarios, what if you only want to display a `Calendar`? `vue-day-calendar` is created to solve this problem.

## âœ¨ Main features
-  A calendar component focused on date selection
-  Using [`dayjs`](https://dayjs.gitee.io/en) as the date library
-  Localizable into any language
-  Easy to style and customize


## VS Vue datepicker
Before `vue-day-calendar`, I used [`vue-datepicker`](https://vue3datepicker.com/), which is an outstanding component library with lots of out-of-the-box features. It also supports displaying in `Calendar` mode, but if you only use the `Calendar` mode, I feel it's too massive and not pure enough, lacking flexibility. Thus, `vue-day-calendar` was born, keeping the purity and uninhibited nature of a `Calendar` component.

## VS React DayPicker
`React` has a rich component ecosystem, and the inspiration for `vue-day-calendar` comes from [`React DayPicker`](https://react-day-picker.js.org/). It has a simple and durable design appearance and highly customizable styles. Each component inside can be customized, which gives users a high degree of playfulness. As such, `vue-day-calendar` has borrowed a lot of ideas.
